# Introduction to Python at SciPy 2021

Monday, July 12 from 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM CDT

This tutorial is a gentle introduction to Python for folks who are completely
new to it and may not have much experience programming.
We’ll work in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
one of the most popular tools in scientific Python.
You’ll learn how to write beautiful Python while practicing loops, if’s,
functions, and usage of Python’s built-in features in a series of fun,
interactive exercises.
By the end of the tutorial we think you’ll be ready to write your own
basic Python -- but most importantly, we want you to learn the form and
vocabulary of Python so that you can understand Python documentation and
interpret code written by others.

See the tutorial description on the conference website
[here](https://www.scipy2021.scipy.org/tutorial-information).

## Setup Instructions

**Please do at least the download and install of Anaconda before coming to the tutorial!**
**We can help with further setup at the tutorial.**

If you don't already have Anaconda installed, download and install Anaconda
for **Python 3** (_not Python 2_):
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

If you're prompted to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
we recommend you **do** install it unless you already have a code editor
you prefer.

After installing Anaconda you can test your installation using
[these instructions](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal).


If you'd like to do your own setup, we'll be using the following Python libraries:

### Backup Option: Binder

If you're not able to get Anaconda installed/working you can
still follow along in class by going to this URL and launching the notebooks:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jiffyclub/scipy-2021-intro-to-python/HEAD.
However, note that Binder will not persist your work and will "forget" about
it after a period of idleness.
Make sure to download your work as soon as you finish a lesson so you can
keep a record.
